# Node.js CRUD Fetch

This is similar to Node.js CRUD Vanilla application for the exception
it uses the AJAX technique with the new standard fetch api. Fetch is a
cool api that unifies the HTTP interface through the use of JavaScript
objects. 

Its not a really big application but to demonstrate how to make a small
web application with node.js using the fetch api. 

If you want to learn more about the fetch api check out the exellent article
at MDN web docs from monzilla. They go into a bit more indepth in the subject
matter but you can also use my source code as a suplument material as well

The other thing this crud app demonstrates is how to create a web applicatoin
without a framework such as express.js. I'll be adding an example of using
express.js later.
